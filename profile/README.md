# Wallet as your sovereign computer
Meteor is building the next generation of personal computers that are fully owned and controlled by individuals.
It allows your wallet to store data, run computations and monetize your online everything.

## Data wallet

[Meteor extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dataverse/kcigpjcafekokoclamfendmaapcljead) is a browser extension that provides a secure and private environment for users to manage their digital assets, including identity, data, attestations, credentials and more. It unlocks the possibility for users to own and control their digital footprints, and to monetize their data in a privacy-preserving way.

## Meteor cloud

[Meteor cloud](https://meteor.computer/) is a web3 personal cloud drive owned by wallets, backed by decentralized data networks, controlled by individuals and attested by blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc. It also works as a storage layer for DApps to store and access user data while users remain in control of their data.

## Meteor SDK

[Meteor SDK](https://github.com/meteor-web3/meteor-sdk) is a JavaScript library that provides a set of APIs for developers to build DApps that can store and access user data in Meteor cloud.
